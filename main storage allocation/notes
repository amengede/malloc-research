A note on older IBM systems. In these systems memory allocation could
be implicit (side effect of OS operation) or explicit (requested by
user). Similarly memory frees can be implicit or explicit.

Explicit allocations can have fixed or variable size and are
conditional or unconditional.
variable size: specify minimum acceptible and larger preferred amount
conditional: program can proceed as normal if request cannot be met
unconditional: program cannot proceed without success

Although this is not very relevant to my research, and I can't
immediately think of use cases for these other flags, it's an example
of some of the richness which has been lost as the process was refined.
As a matter of fact, malloc and free within the user space can be used
to implement these flags.
